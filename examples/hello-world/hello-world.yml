# Workflows  define sequences of commands written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and must be
# located under the directory `.github/workflows/` at the root of your repository.
# ::newline
# This example workflow prints "Hello world", then "Goodbye".

# ::span-comment
# We must specify what events trigger the workflow to run.
# In this case we run it every time someone pushes to the repo.
