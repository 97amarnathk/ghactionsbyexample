# Actions reduce workflow `steps` by providing reusabe "code"
# for common tasks.
# To run an action, you include the `uses` keyword
# pointing to a GitHub repo with the pattern
# `{owner}/{repo}@{ref}` or `{owner}/{repo}/{path}@{ref}`
# if it's in a subdirectory. A `ref` can be a branch, tag, or SHA.
